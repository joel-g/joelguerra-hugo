You know that perfect username you've been eyeing? The one that's been taken since 2012 by someone who posted twice and disappeared? Or that domain name that would be *perfect* for your brand, but some squatter is holding it hostage? What if I told you there's now a way to know the *instant* they become available?

Introducing [NameCamper](https://namecamper.com) — a monitoring service that watches your dream usernames and domain names so you don't have to obsessively check them at 3am.

## The Problem

We've all been there. You want `@coolname` on Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, or whatever platform the kids are using these days. But it's taken. So you settle for `@coolname_2847` or `@the_real_coolname` like some kind of animal.

Same story with domains. You want `coolbrand.com` but it's parked by a squatter asking $15,000 for it, or it's sitting on some abandoned website from 2008. So you end up with `getcoolbrand.io` or `coolbrand-app.com` and hope nobody notices.

The thing is, usernames and domains become available all the time. Social accounts get deleted. People rebrand. Platforms do cleanup sweeps of inactive accounts. Domains expire when owners forget to renew. But unless you're manually checking every day, you'll never know when your perfect name opens up.

## How NameCamper Works

It's dead simple:

1. Sign up at [namecamper.com](https://namecamper.com)
2. Add the usernames or domains you want to monitor
3. For usernames, select which platforms to watch (Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, etc.)
4. We check availability automatically and notify you when something opens up

That's it. No more calendar reminders to "check if @username is available yet." No more WHOIS lookups to see if that domain finally expired. No more missing your window because you were asleep or, you know, living your life.

## Currently in Beta (aka Free)

Here's the fun part — NameCamper is currently in beta, which means **all features are completely free** while we iron out the kinks. You get access to:

- Social media username monitoring (Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and more)
- Domain name monitoring (watch for expiring or dropped domains)
- Automatic availability checks
- Email notifications when your name becomes available

We're using this beta period to gather feedback and make sure the service is rock solid before we start charging. So if you've got opinions, we want to hear them.

## Try It Out

Head over to [namecamper.com](https://namecamper.com), create an account, and start camping on those usernames and domains you've been dreaming about. It's free during beta, so there's literally no reason not to.

And as always, if you have feedback, bugs to report, or just want to tell me about the name you finally snagged — hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joelatwar).

Happy camping!
