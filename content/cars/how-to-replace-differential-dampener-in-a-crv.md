I tried something new. I wasn't even going to write about this because it's such a simple fix *but* I wanted to try out my new GoPro so I made a video instead!

BUT if you came here actually wanting to know how to do this but don't want to watch a video (I hear ya) then I'll take care of that too.

Get under your car, bring a 17mm socket wrench with you. In the video I used a [Husky electric ratchet](https://amzn.to/2PT7l8A) and a [3/8" breaker bar](https://amzn.to/2OCNYjo) but you could do the job with the most basic 17mm wrench if you needed to.

1. Locate the long bolt coming from the right side (passenger side) of the differential mount. It goes all the way through the mount and into the threaded hole on the dampener. 

2. Back out the bolt with your 17mm tool of choice until the dampener drops to the ground.

3. Thread the bolt on to your *new* dampener and tighten it.

You're done! 

Now watch the video because I went to the effort of attaching a GoPro to the underside of my CR-V.
