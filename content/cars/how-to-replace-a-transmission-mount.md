While rooting out the “clunking” sound my 2004 Accord has been making I noticed a very worn looking transmission mount. We can see it is torn in at least 2 places.

These mounts are cheap but very important. So let’s replace it. To access it I’ll need to remove this air intake.

Before I unbolt the mount, I’ll need to support the transmission from below by placing this jack with a piece of wood up against the bottom of the transmission.

Now I can safely remove the 14mm center bolt in the mount.

This mount is totally shot.

The mount has three 14mm bolts located on the underside. I pulled the battery to give me some room but it’s not enough. The battery tray will have to come out.

The battery tray is held in with four 12mm bolts.

With the tray out of the way I can see the first bolt.

It’s very tough but it came out.

Apparently the entire outside of the rubber on the mount was torn so the center just… fell out.

This other bracket has to come out in order for me to access the next mount bolt.

I partially rounded off the next bolt trying to loosen it with a wrench so I used this [special “grip” socket that grabs the sides](https://amzn.to/2ScT0RT) instead of the corners to remove it.

This is kind of hard to see but with the first 2 bolts out I can swing the mount up to access the final bolt.

Now we can drop the new in… Nice firm rubber.

Bolt it up and replace the bracket it bolts to. We’re cruising now.

It is now supporting the transmission so I can remove the jack.

Now it’s just a matter of reinstalling the battery tray, battery and intake and going on a test drive!

Thanks for reading!
