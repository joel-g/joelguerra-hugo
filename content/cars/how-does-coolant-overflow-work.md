# How the Coolant Overflow Reservoir Works in a Honda Engine

If you've ever popped the hood of your Honda, you've likely noticed the semi-transparent plastic container labeled "coolant" or "engine coolant." This unassuming component is called the coolant overflow reservoir (also known as the coolant expansion tank or recovery tank), and it plays a crucial role in your Honda's cooling system. Today, I'll explain how this simple yet effective system works and why it's important to keep an eye on it.

## The Purpose of the Coolant Overflow Reservoir

The coolant overflow reservoir serves several important functions in your Honda's cooling system:

1. **Manages coolant expansion**: When your engine heats up during operation, the coolant expands. The reservoir provides a place for this expanding fluid to go instead of being forced out of the system.

2. **Maintains proper coolant levels**: It helps ensure your radiator maintains the optimal amount of coolant at all times.

3. **Prevents air pockets**: The system helps purge air from the cooling system, which can cause overheating if allowed to build up.

4. **Reduces coolant waste**: Before overflow reservoirs became standard, expanding coolant would simply spill onto the ground, requiring more frequent top-ups.

## How It Works: The Pressure Cycle

The coolant overflow system in your Honda operates on a simple yet ingenious pressure cycle that leverages basic physics:

### When the Engine is Running (Hot Cycle)

1. As your Honda's engine warms up, the coolant inside the radiator and engine expands.

2. This expansion creates pressure in the closed cooling system.

3. When the pressure reaches a specific threshold (typically 12-16 PSI in most Hondas), the radiator cap's pressure relief valve opens.

4. Excess coolant flows through a small hose from the radiator into the overflow reservoir.

5. The reservoir's level rises, which is why you'll notice the "HOT" marking is higher than the "COLD" marking.

### When the Engine Cools Down (Cold Cycle)

1. As your engine cools after being shut off, the coolant temperature drops.

2. The coolant contracts, creating a vacuum in the cooling system.

3. The vacuum causes the radiator cap's second valve to open, which allows coolant to be drawn back from the reservoir into the radiator.

4. This maintains the proper coolant level in the radiator without manual intervention.

5. The reservoir's level drops back to the "COLD" mark.

This continuous cycle ensures that your Honda's cooling system always has the right amount of coolant, regardless of temperature fluctuations.

## The Radiator Cap: The Unsung Hero

While the reservoir gets all the attention because it's visible, the radiator cap is actually the component that controls this entire process. On Honda vehicles, you'll typically find a 1.1 bar (16 PSI) cap, which determines the pressure at which coolant will be released to the overflow tank.

The cap contains two spring-loaded valves:
- A pressure relief valve that opens when system pressure exceeds the cap's rating
- A vacuum valve that opens to draw coolant back in during cooling

This is why it's crucial to replace your radiator cap with one of the correct pressure rating if it ever fails.

## Monitoring Your Coolant Reservoir

The translucent design of Honda's coolant reservoirs makes it easy to monitor coolant levels:

- When the engine is cold, the fluid level should be at or near the "COLD" or "MIN" mark.
- When the engine is hot, the level should be near the "HOT" or "MAX" mark.

If you notice that the reservoir is consistently empty or overflowing, or if the level doesn't change between cold and hot states, there could be an issue with your cooling system that needs attention.

## Upgrading Your Honda's Coolant System

I have several videos on my YouTube channel that cover how to upgrade your Honda's cooling system, including the radiator and hoses. In the video below I replace the plastic coolant overflow reservoir with a metal one from Evil Energy

## Common Issues with the Overflow System

Several problems can affect your Honda's coolant overflow system:

1. **Cracked reservoir**: The plastic can become brittle over time, especially in older Hondas like CR-Vs, Civics, and Accords from the 90s and early 2000s.

2. **Failed radiator cap**: If the cap's valves don't open and close properly, the system won't function as designed.

3. **Clogged overflow hose**: Debris or corrosion can block the small hose connecting the radiator to the reservoir.

4. **Internal coolant leaks**: Head gasket issues can cause pressure problems that affect the overflow system.

5. **External leaks**: Leaks anywhere in the cooling system can disrupt the pressure cycle.

## Maintenance Tips

Maintaining your Honda's coolant overflow system is straightforward:

1. **Regular inspection**: Check the coolant level when the engine is cold. It should be between the "MIN" and "MAX" marks.

2. **Use the right coolant**: Honda typically recommends their Type 2 blue coolant for older models and Type 2 OL blue or Type 2 green for newer ones. Always dilute concentrated coolant with distilled water according to specifications (usually 50/50).

3. **Replace the reservoir if cracked**: If you notice cracks or leaks, replace the reservoir promptly. Fortunately, these are relatively inexpensive parts.

4. **Change the radiator cap**: Consider replacing the radiator cap as preventative maintenance every 5-6 years, as the springs and seals can weaken over time.

5. **Follow the maintenance schedule**: Adhere to Honda's recommended coolant change intervals, which typically range from 5-10 years or 60,000-100,000 miles, depending on your specific model.

The coolant overflow reservoir in your Honda is a perfect example of clever automotive engineeringâ€”a simple system that solves multiple problems efficiently. By understanding how it works and keeping an eye on it during routine maintenance, you can help ensure your Honda's cooling system continues to function properly for years to come.
