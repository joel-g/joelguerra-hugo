Hi, I'm Joel Guerra. 

I'm a software engineer. I like to work with Azure, Go and Python.
I get paid to automate stuff, make things resilient, and make things performant.
In my free time I work on cars. I might write about these things.

I'm not a web developer or a designer. I slapped this website together from a bunch of open source stuff and piled it on a bunch of free PaaS services. Someday it will probably break because of some dependency I don't understand. It might looked messed up on device with your weirdo browser. You can yell at me about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joelatwar).
