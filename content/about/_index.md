Hi, I'm Joel Guerra. 

I'm a software engineer. I like to work with Go, Javascript and CDNs.
I get paid to make things very fast for a very large company.
In my free time I work on cars and play with the latest tech. I might write about these things.

If my site is broken you can yell at me about it on [Twitter](https://x.com/joelatwar).
