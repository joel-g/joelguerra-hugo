      <description>Today I’m going to restore these aluminum wheels.
These are OEM 16” x 7.5&amp;rdquo; Honda S2000 wheels. They’re made in Japan by Enkei. They’re pretty sought after but I got this set for $120 on Craigslist because they are in rough shape and have no tires.
The plan:
🔹Sand the failed clear coat
🔹Fill in the curb gouged edges
🔹Prime, paint and clear coat
Here are the supplies I’ll be using.</description>

      <description>This is not necessarily a “how to” but more of a “how I did it” because with something this custom there isn’t just one way to do it. This was my journey… oh, and links to parts and tools are affiliate links and I may earn a couple bucks if you buy them.
If you’ve ever sat in a first generation Honda CR-V you knew you were sitting in a masterpiece.</description>

      <description>2004 Honda Accord outside of a detail shop
This is my 2004 Accord. It has been my daily driver for 6 years. It has 285k miles. Everything works and it’s great — except that lately the throttle has been… weird. It starts jerky and doesn’t cruise at a consistent speed even if I am very smooth with my pedal input. I hooked up my OBD reader (on-board diagnostic reader) to see if I had any error codes.</description>

      <description>I’m going to show you how to restore the lower plastic trim on this ‘99 Honda Prelude but the process will be the same on most cars.
