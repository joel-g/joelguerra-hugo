      <description>The city of Bellevue, Washington recently debuted an online tool to allow residents to report ‚Äúgatherings‚Äù or other violations of Governor Inslee‚Äôs ‚Äúshelter in place‚Äù order. Bellevue Police Department plans to make a heat map to identify areas with high concentrations of violations. This guide will walk through how to reverse engineer an API and use Go‚Äôs standard library to send form data. We‚Äôll use the ‚Äúreport a gathering‚Äù application as the example API.</description>

      <description>In this edition of ‚Äúthe Martin files‚Äù I cobbled together Martin‚Äôs gigantic twitter thread (with his permission) documenting a complete gaming PC build. This is the highest budget thread to date! Have fun!
üñ•Ô∏è LET‚ÄôS BUILD A COMPUTER TOGETHER! üñ•Ô∏è
I‚Äôm building a PC for work &amp;amp; games and I‚Äôm going to share my experience for folks who are thinking about it. Even on my 8th-9th build, I make mistakes and learn new things.</description>

      <description>This week I‚Äôm stealing all of Martin Castro&amp;rsquo;s hardwork from Twitter (with his permission) to bring you his guide on using Postman to consume APIs. This is a great way to test an API before you starting writing code. The rest of this post is straight from Martin‚Äôs thread:
üëΩ LEARNING THE HARD WAY: API basics with Postman üëΩ
I am going to use Github‚Äôs Noop Challenge ‚Äî Hexbot to teach y‚Äôall about one of biggest tools in my API toolbelt, Postman.</description>

      <description>Here‚Äôs another edition of Martin Castro live tweeting hardware and me collecting it all into a single digestible blog post. The rest of this post is direct from Martin‚Äôs finger tips here. Enjoy!
Let‚Äôs check out this beginner / intermediate microcontroller kit! I am working on a TOP SECRET project with @joelatwar and @CodeSpent and I thought I‚Äôd take a couple minutes to talk about this lil‚Äô IoT device and unbox it.</description>

      <description>My buddy Martin Castro likes to live tweet hardware projects. When he‚Äôs done you have a detailed step-by-step guide that anyone can follow along. However, since it‚Äôs a Twitter thread it is quickly lost to time. ‚ÄúThe Martin Files‚Äù is my attempt to capture this content (with his permission) so others can find, read and learn from it in the future. The rest of this article (including the images) will be verbatim from his Twitter thread:</description>

      <description>If you‚Äôre a developer or student you probably have a Stack Overflow account. If you‚Äôre as (overly) competitive as I am you probably compare your Stack Overflow reputation with your colleagues. If you‚Äôre a real weirdo you might even want a sort-able leader board to compare yourself against your friends, enemies, etc.
Well, look no further than this simple Python Flask application!

Here is an example of this website in action using myself and some friends: http://sampleleaderboard.</description>

      <title>Why I Blasted Your Drug Deals on Twitter</title>

      <description>How it happened A couple of days ago Twitter user Mike Rundle tweeted a link for the endpoint to Venmo‚Äôs public API. I learned that Venmo‚Äôs public by default setting made the details of millions of Venmo transactions publicly available to anyone who cared to look. So I did what any software engineer would do and started digging through the data. I could see the names, Facebook profile pictures, payment types and ‚Äúmessage‚Äù fields that users filled out when they made a transaction.</description>

      <title>How To: SSH to Your Azure Linux VMs With Username and Password From Windows, Linux or Mac</title>

      <description>If you‚Äôre looking to generate SSH keys and use them to login to an Azure Linux VM then good on you because that‚Äôs the recommended and most secure method to access your VMs. It‚Äôs readily documented here in official documentation. However, I‚Äôve seen people asking on forums how to simply connect to a Linux VM hosted in Azure via SSH with a username and password. If that‚Äôs you then I assume you have a good reason (like this VM will generally not have ports open to the internet or this is a proof of concept) and this post will detail how.</description>

      <title>How To: Embed Your Azure Web App Bot in Any Web Page</title>

      <description>Embedding an Azure bot in your web page is actually very simple but the Azure portal doesn‚Äôt make it obvious how to do this. The portal blade for bots is geared towards developers who are integrating bots into channels like Skype, Facebook Messenger, Slack, SMS, etc but I‚Äôve seen several questions on Stack Overflow asking how to simply slap the bot on a web page - so here you go.</description>
