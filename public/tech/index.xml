      <description>Make a Stack Overflow Reputation Leader Board for your team with Python If you’re a developer or student you probably have a Stack Overflow account. If you’re as (overly) competitive as I am you probably compare your Stack Overflow reputation with your colleagues. If you’re a real weirdo you might even want a sort-able leader board to compare yourself against your friends, enemies, etc.
Well, look no further than this simple Python Flask application!</description>

      <description>Why I Blasted Your “Drug” Deals on Twitter How it happened A couple of days ago Twitter user Mike Rundle tweeted a link for the endpoint to Venmo’s public API. I learned that Venmo’s public by default setting made the details of millions of Venmo transactions publicly available to anyone who cared to look. So I did what any software engineer would do and started digging through the data. I could see the names, Facebook profile pictures, payment types and “message” fields that users filled out when they made a transaction.</description>

The portal blade for bots is geared towards developers who are integrating bots into channels like Skype, Facebook Messenger, Slack, SMS, etc but I’ve seen several questions on Stack Overflow asking how to simply slap the bot on a web page - so here you go.</description>
