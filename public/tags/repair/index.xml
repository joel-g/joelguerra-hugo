      <description>Today I’m going to restore these aluminum wheels.
These are OEM 16” x 7.5&amp;rdquo; Honda S2000 wheels. They’re made in Japan by Enkei. They’re pretty sought after but I got this set for $120 on Craigslist because they are in rough shape and have no tires.
The plan:
🔹Sand the failed clear coat
🔹Fill in the curb gouged edges
🔹Prime, paint and clear coat
Here are the supplies I’ll be using.</description>

      <description>2004 Honda Accord outside of a detail shop
This is my 2004 Accord. It has been my daily driver for 6 years. It has 285k miles. Everything works and it’s great — except that lately the throttle has been… weird. It starts jerky and doesn’t cruise at a consistent speed even if I am very smooth with my pedal input. I hooked up my OBD reader (on-board diagnostic reader) to see if I had any error codes.</description>

      <description>I’m going to show you how to restore the lower plastic trim on this ‘99 Honda Prelude but the process will be the same on most cars.
Everyone knows that the Honda Prelude is one of humanity’s finest achievements. In terms of engineering, style and heritage it has few rivals — But sadly the last one rolled off the assembly line in 2001. Those of us who own one today have a moral obligation to maintain it.</description>
