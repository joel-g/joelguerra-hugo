      <description>The city of Bellevue, Washington recently debuted an online tool to allow residents to report ‚Äúgatherings‚Äù or other violations of Governor Inslee‚Äôs ‚Äúshelter in place‚Äù order. Bellevue Police Department plans to make a heat map to identify areas with high concentrations of violations. This guide will walk through how to reverse engineer an API and use Go‚Äôs standard library to send form data. We‚Äôll use the ‚Äúreport a gathering‚Äù application as the example API.</description>

      <description>This week I‚Äôm stealing all of Martin Castro&amp;rsquo;s hardwork from Twitter (with his permission) to bring you his guide on using Postman to consume APIs. This is a great way to test an API before you starting writing code. The rest of this post is straight from Martin‚Äôs thread:
üëΩ LEARNING THE HARD WAY: API basics with Postman üëΩ
I am going to use Github‚Äôs Noop Challenge ‚Äî Hexbot to teach y‚Äôall about one of biggest tools in my API toolbelt, Postman.</description>

      <description>If you‚Äôre a developer or student you probably have a Stack Overflow account. If you‚Äôre as (overly) competitive as I am you probably compare your Stack Overflow reputation with your colleagues. If you‚Äôre a real weirdo you might even want a sort-able leader board to compare yourself against your friends, enemies, etc.
Well, look no further than this simple Python Flask application!

Here is an example of this website in action using myself and some friends: http://sampleleaderboard.</description>

      <description>If you‚Äôre looking to generate SSH keys and use them to login to an Azure Linux VM then good on you because that‚Äôs the recommended and most secure method to access your VMs. It‚Äôs readily documented here in official documentation. However, I‚Äôve seen people asking on forums how to simply connect to a Linux VM hosted in Azure via SSH with a username and password. If that‚Äôs you then I assume you have a good reason (like this VM will generally not have ports open to the internet or this is a proof of concept) and this post will detail how.</description>

      <description>Embedding an Azure bot in your web page is actually very simple but the Azure portal doesn‚Äôt make it obvious how to do this. The portal blade for bots is geared towards developers who are integrating bots into channels like Skype, Facebook Messenger, Slack, SMS, etc but I‚Äôve seen several questions on Stack Overflow asking how to simply slap the bot on a web page - so here you go.</description>
