      <description>In this edition of “the Martin files” I cobbled together Martin’s gigantic twitter thread (with his permission) documenting a complete gaming PC build. This is the highest budget thread to date! Have fun!
🖥️ LET’S BUILD A COMPUTER TOGETHER! 🖥️
I’m building a PC for work &amp;amp; games and I’m going to share my experience for folks who are thinking about it. Even on my 8th-9th build, I make mistakes and learn new things.</description>

      <title>API Basics With Postman — the Martin files</title>

      <description>This week I’m stealing all of Martin Castro&amp;rsquo;s hardwork from Twitter (with his permission) to bring you his guide on using Postman to consume APIs. This is a great way to test an API before you starting writing code. The rest of this post is straight from Martin’s thread:
👽 LEARNING THE HARD WAY: API basics with Postman 👽
I am going to use Github’s Noop Challenge — Hexbot to teach y’all about one of biggest tools in my API toolbelt, Postman.</description>

      <description>Here’s another edition of Martin Castro live tweeting hardware and me collecting it all into a single digestible blog post. The rest of this post is direct from Martin’s finger tips here. Enjoy!
Let’s check out this beginner / intermediate microcontroller kit! I am working on a TOP SECRET project with @joelatwar and @CodeSpent and I thought I’d take a couple minutes to talk about this lil’ IoT device and unbox it.</description>

      <title>Getting Started With Microcontrollers — the Martin files</title>

      <description>My buddy Martin Castro likes to live tweet hardware projects. When he’s done you have a detailed step-by-step guide that anyone can follow along. However, since it’s a Twitter thread it is quickly lost to time. “The Martin Files” is my attempt to capture this content (with his permission) so others can find, read and learn from it in the future. The rest of this article (including the images) will be verbatim from his Twitter thread:</description>
